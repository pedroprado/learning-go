Unit Testing

-Tests should be fast ( miliseconds)
-Each test should cover independent modules: if some testing modules has dependency,
 this dependency should be mocked
-Tests should cover every possible outcome (test cases)
-Each outcome should be a test: ONE ASSERTION PER TEST CASE SHOULD BE THE IDEAL!
