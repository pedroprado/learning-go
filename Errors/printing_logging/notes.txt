Using log packgae, we can change de destination of logs using log.SetOutPut() 

log.Fatal => no recovery from error. Does not run deferred functions.
log.Panic => can recovery from error, using recover() function. Does run deferred functions

defer keyword => postpones the execution of a function till the surrounding functions returns,
either normally or through a panic


function panic() (it is not the same as log.Panic !!!) :
this function is called when the system has issues.
