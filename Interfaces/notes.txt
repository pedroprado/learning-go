Concrete Types x Interface Types

Concrete = map, struct, int, string, etc. We can create a value out of these Types
Interface = we can not create a value out of this type


Interfaces are not GENERIC Types
Interfaces are implicit = we dont say explicitly that "englishBot" is of type "bot" 
                                        (like using "implements" keyword in Java)
Interfaces are CONTRACTS that helps with TYPES (not with logical implementation!)
Interfaces are tough: step 1 is to understand how to read them!
